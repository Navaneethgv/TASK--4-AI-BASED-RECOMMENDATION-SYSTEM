*Company*:Codtech It solutions

*Intern Id*:CT04WE92

*Domain*:Java

*Duration*:4 weeks

*Mentor*:NEELA SANTHOSH

📝 Project Overview
This recommendation engine built with Apache Mahout provides personalized product recommendations based on user preferences. Developed during my internship, this project demonstrates collaborative filtering techniques to predict user preferences and suggest relevant items.

🌟 Key Features
User-based collaborative filtering recommendations

Pearson correlation similarity for user matching

Threshold-based neighborhood selection

CSV data integration for preference modeling

Scalable architecture using Mahout's algorithms

💻 Code Walkthrough
1. Data Loading
java
Copy
DataModel model = new FileDataModel(new File("src/main/resources/user_preferences.csv"));
2. Similarity Calculation
java
Copy
UserSimilarity similarity = new PearsonCorrelationSimilarity(model);
3. Neighborhood Formation
java
Copy
UserNeighborhood neighborhood = new ThresholdUserNeighborhood(0.1, similarity, model);
4. Recommendation Generation
java
Copy
UserBasedRecommender recommender = new GenericUserBasedRecommender(model, neighborhood, similarity);
List<RecommendedItem> recommendations = recommender.recommend(1, 3);
📊 Sample Output
plaintext
Copy
Recommended Products for User 1:
Item: 102 | Score: 4.5
Item: 103 | Score: 3.8
Item: 104 | Score: 3.2
